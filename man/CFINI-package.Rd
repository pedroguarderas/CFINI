\description{
This package was created with implement different computational routines that can
be applied to solve pricig problems, that are usually presented in Finance and Actuarial Science.

Here a list of the main numerical methods implemented inside \pkg{CFINI}. Many of this functions
are coded with C++ by employing the packages Rcpp and RcppEigen.
\enumerate{
\item Pricing with trees.
\item Pricing with multinomial trees.
\item Ordinary differential equation solver implemented with the predictor-corrector method.
\item Diffusion solver with Euler implicit scheme.
\item Diffusion solver with Crank-Nicolson scheme.
