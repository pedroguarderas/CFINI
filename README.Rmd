#CFINI

This package was created with the pourpose to implement different computational routines that 
can be applied to solve stochastic problems, mainly with applications in finance and actuarial 
science.

Several functions are implemented with C++ by employing the packages Rcpp and RcppEigen.

- Pricing with trees
- Pricing with multinomial trees
- Ordinary differential equation solver implemented with the predictor-corrector method
- Diffusion solver with Euler implicit scheme
- Diffusion solver with Crank-Nicolson scheme
